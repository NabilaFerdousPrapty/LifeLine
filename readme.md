# Multimodal Disaster Classification using CLIP 

This repository contains the official implementation of a high-precision multimodal classifier for disaster response. By leveraging **Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation (DoRA)** on a **CLIP** backbone, this project surpasses traditional full fine-tuning benchmarks (89%) to achieve **>90% accuracy** on the CrisisMMD dataset while training only **~2.5%** of the parameters.
